### Database Configuration

Once you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) configured in your computer, with your Docker engine running, you must execute the following command provision the source database:


> docker-compose up


:warning:**Important**: Before running this command make sure you're in the root folder of the project.

Once you have the Database up and running feel free to connect to this using any tool you want, for this you can use the following credentials:

- **Username**: `finance_db_user`
- **Password**: `1234`
- **Database**: `finance_db`
